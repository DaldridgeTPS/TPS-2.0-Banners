# 2.0 Banners

Hi Guys, as you know, banners are a bit different on 2.0. Hopefully this guide helps out a bit, and if not just drop me a message on teams ðŸ™‚

**Here is the process I would follow when create a new banner.**

-   Select the file you want above, for example if you are creating a "Campaign Banner" click "campaign-banner.html".
-   This will take you to a new page, copy the code and paste it into your text editor. I use "Visual Studio Code", but you can use "Sublime" "Notepad" if you really like living on the edge.
-   Do a "Find & Replace" to change every mention of "unique-name" to something unique to that Banner. This will stop it being overwritten by other styles from banners, and stop it overwriting other banners.
-   Update any colours you need to for text. I will update the "colour" reference below so you should be able to grab any relevant colours from there.
-   Hopefully you don't need to update the "font-size" at all, but if the banner looks weird feel free to change it.
-   Copy the code and paste it into the "Content" section of the banner component.
-   You wont need to configure the button on the component because it already exists in the code you just added in.
-   Sync and do all that business!
